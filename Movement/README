PID: Pre-define a coordinate to move to in python script. Robot's movement is controlled by the PID.
simplemove: Pre-define a coordinate to move to in python script. Robot stops and rotates before moving forward towards goal.
AStar: Uses a Pre-defined map (empty_wall.launch in ROSDS) that must be changed for different environments. Finds the shortest path. (does not actually move the robot)
DAstar: Uses a Pre-defined map (empty_wall.launch in ROSDS) that must be changed for different environments. First calculates shortest path, then moves the robot (movement is a combo of simplemove and PID). Collision causes rerouting of new shortest path.
