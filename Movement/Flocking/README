copy both multi_robot package and flocking_large package into ros

1) In first shell, "roslaunch multi_robot main.launch"

2) Open gazebo

3) In second shell, "roslaunch flocking flockng.launch"

4) In third shell, "rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py /cmd_vel:=/robot1/cmd_vel" to control the leader robot movement

currently multi_robot package is set to deploy 3 robots (can easily be changed in robots.launch file, if changed then flocking must be adapted as well)

*currently working on flocking code that will work for any number of robots*
