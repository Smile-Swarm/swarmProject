# swarmProject
Design for cloud-based rovers to perform image processing over a wireless distributed-computing framework using Jetson Nano, Zigbees and Arduino.

**Description**:
Our Senior Design Project is to create an autonomous mobile distributed computing network between Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). Our team of engineers is responsible for communications, controls, autonomous movement, circuitry, and PCB design for the UGV’s. The project will be geared towards improving upon the current Senior Design B team, Smile Cloud 9, that is currently working with Professor Xie on Swarm Artificial Intelligence capabilities.

**Problem Statement**:
Computational tasks such as large matrix algebra proves to be a formidable task for one node to handle. Multiple nodes in a network makes it possible to alleviate task loads between each other thus optimizing the time to complete a task. In order to supplement Dr. Xie’s SysteMs & InteLligEnce (SMILE) Laboratory research on dynamic networks and distributed computing, our team will design and implement robots in order to divide time extensive computational tasks amongst each other.
