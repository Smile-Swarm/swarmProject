Object Localization

In a video tracking problem, centroid pixel location of moving targets in an image frame are extracted using video processing algorithms which represent the kinematic measurements for the video tracking system [1]. We can then use the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the camera in an algorithm to determine the real-world location of an object in relation to the real-world location of the husky.
